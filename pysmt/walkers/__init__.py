"""Provides walkers to navigate formulas.

Two types of walkers are provided: DagWalker and TreeWalker.

Internally, the Walkers have a dictionary that maps each FNode type to
the appropriate function to be called. When subclassing a Walker
remember to specify an action for the nodes of interest. Nodes for
which a behavior has not been specified will raise a
NotImplementedError exception.

Finally, an *experimental* meta class is provided called
CombinerWalker. This class takes a list of walkers and returns a new
walker that applies all the walkers to the formula. The idea is that
multiple information can be extracted from the formula by navigating
it only once.
